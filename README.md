# AngularJS Go to Definition Extension

This extension provides `Go to definition` support for custom AngularJS directives or components in your HTML files, making it easier for you to navigate through your project and improve your productivity.

## Features

- Quickly navigate to the JavaScript file containing the definition of the custom directive or component.
- Supports HTML and JavaScript files.

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
2. Reload Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

- Right-click on a custom directive or component in an HTML file and select `Go to Definition.`
- Alternatively, press `F12` when the cursor is on a custom directive or component.
- You can also use `Ctrl+Click` or `Right-Click` then select `Go to Definition.`

## Customization

### Excluding paths

To improve performance and reduce "noise", you may want to exclude certain paths from being searched for custom directives or components. It's recommended to exclude the `node_modules` folder at the very least.

To exclude paths, you can update your extension settings in Visual Studio Code.
